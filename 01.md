## 2. Tips about Lexical Pitfalls

---

1. = is not ==

2. & and | are not && and ||

3. Greedy (Maximal Munch) Lexical analysis strategy
   - "repeatedly bite off the biggest possible piece"
   - ```a---b``` means ```a-- -b``` 
   - y = x/*p , y = x / *p, y = x / (*p) 
4. Integer Constants
   - 010 (octal, 010 means 8) --- 10 (decimal)
5. Strings and Characters
   - single quote ('a') is just another way of an integer ( 0141 or 97 )
   - double quote ("a") is a character array (['a', '\0'])
   - ```printf("\n") ``` BUT NOT ```printf('\n')```!!!)
